<h1> Path from four Bearings </h1> 

The animation (generated with <a
    href="http://www.cinderella.de">Cinderella</a>) provides a visualization of the 4-bearings method, namely the generation of a path from four bearings from known positions, see <a href="https://ricojansen.nl/downloads/the_four_bearings_method_v2,Kuikueg.pdf"> Kuikueg.pdf </a>.
		
<p>  An observer is taking bearings a, b, c, and d from positions U, V, W, and X to collinear positions M, N, O, and P at constant time intervals, assuming the result from a vehicle moving at constant speed on the unknown path i. The task is to determine the vehicle's path in space and time.  </p>
    
<p> The positions U, V, W, and X can be moved. The bearings a, b, c, and d can be changed by rotating the green arrows. The path i of the vehicle is constructed together with the positions M, N, O, and P.</p>
